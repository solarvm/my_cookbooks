  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nInstalls and configures SNORT.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nTested on Ubuntu. May work on Debian, and Red Hat family distributions. Won't work on other platforms.\n\nCookbooks\n----\n\nNo other cookbooks are strictly required, however to use one of the database backends, the appropriate cookbook should be used. For example, Opscode cookbooks:\n\n* mysql\n* postgresql\n\nAttributes\n==========\n\n* `node['snort']['home_net']` - Address range to use for preseeding `HOME_NET`. Default 192.168.0.0/16 on Ubuntu/Debian, all others any.\n* `node['snort']['database']` - What database backend to use. Default none. MySQL and PostgreSQL are usable. The default recipe will install the SNORT package for the appropriate database backend. You'll need to make sure that the database server is set up in some way such that SNORT can connect to it. This cookbook does not yet support automatic configuration.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nInclude `recipe[snort]` in a run list to have the system get SNORT installed. This performs a baseline installation and preseeds the package. You'll probably want to change the `node['snort']['home_net']` attribute to the appropriate network.\n\nWe recommend adding a `template` resource to the default recipe to manage the `/etc/snort/snort.conf` file as a template. The default file is good enough for now on Debian/Ubuntu.\n\nOn Ubuntu/Debian, the default rules package will be installed. You'll need to download and install additional rules. Automatically updating rules with oinkmaster is not yet supported.  See future plans.\n\nFuture Plans\n============\n\nThe following features are planned for a future release of this cookbook. Contributions welcome, see [How to Contribute](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/How+to+Contribute)\n\nPerform additional configuration of `/etc/snort/snort.conf` via template.\n\nPreseed database configuration for SNORT to connect to the database server. This will use Chef search results for the database master.\n\nSupport either RPM or Yum based installations on Red Hat family distributions.\n\nOinkmaster automatic rules updates.\n\nSource-based installation.\n\nOther platforms in general :).\n\nReferences\n==========\n\n* [SNORT home page](http://www.snort.org)\n* [snort -h doesn't do what you think](http://blog.joelesler.net/2010/03/snort-h-doesnt-do-what-you-think-it-does.html)\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor: Joshua Timberman (<joshua@opscode.com>)\nCopyright 2010, Opscode, Inc (<legal@opscode.com>)\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
