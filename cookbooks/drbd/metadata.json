  "long_description": "Description\n===========\nInstalls and configures the Distributed Replicated Block Device (DRBD) service for mirroring block devices between a pair of hosts. Right now it simply works in pairs, multiple hosts could be supported with a few small changes.\n\nThe `drbd` cookbook does not partition drives. It will format partitions given a filesystem type, but it does not explicitly depend on the `xfs` cookbook if you want that type of filesystem, but you can put it in your run list and set the node['drbd']['fs_type'] to 'xfs' or 'ext4' or whatever.\n\nRequirements\n============\nPlatform\n--------\nTested with Ubuntu 10.04 and 10.10. You must have the 'linux-server' package and 'linux-headers-server' kernel installed to properly support the drbd module.\n\nRecipes\n=======\ndefault\n-------\nInstalls drbd but does no configuration.\n\ndefault\n-------\nGiven a filesystem and a partner host, configures block replication between the hosts. The master will claim the primary, format the filesystem and mount the partition. The slave will simply mirror without mounting. **It currently takes 2 chef-client runs to ensure the pair is synced properly.**\n\nAttributes\n==========\nThe required attributes are\n\n* `node['drbd]['remote_host']` - Remote host to pair with.\n* `node['drbd]['disk']` - Disk partition to mirror.\n* `node['drbd]['mount']` - Mount point to mirror.\n* `node['drbd]['fs_type']` - Disk format for the mirrored disk, defaults to `ext3`.\n* `node['drbd]['master']` - Whether this node is master between the pair, defaults to `false`.\n\nRoles\n=====\nThere are a pair of example roles `drbd-pair.rb` and `drbd-pair-master.rb` with the cookbook source.\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor: Matt Ray (<matt@opscode.com>)\n\nCopyright 2011, Opscode, Inc.\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
