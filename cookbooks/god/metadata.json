  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nInstalls god gem, sets up modular configuration directory and provides\na defininition to monitor processes.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nSample configuration file uses mongrel_runit for managing mongrels via\nrunit. Opscode does not have a `mongrel_runit` cookbook, however.\n\n## Platform:\n\n* Debian/Ubuntu\n\n\n## Cookbooks:\n\n* runit\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nThis recipe is designed to be used through the `god_monitor` define. Create a god configuration file in your application's cookbook and then call `god_monitor`:\n\n    god_monitor \"myproj\" do\n      config \"myproj.god.erb\"\n    end\n\nA sample mongrel.god.erb is provided, though it assumes `mongrel_runit` is used. This can be used as a baseline for customization.\n\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Joshua Timberman (<joshua@opscode.com>)\n\nCopyright:: 2009, Opscode, Inc\n\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\");\nyou may not use this file except in compliance with the License.\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at\n\n    http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software\ndistributed under the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\nWITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied.\nSee the License for the specific language governing permissions and\nlimitations under the License.\n",
