  "long_description": "Description\n===========\n\nBuild /etc/ssh/known_hosts based on search indexes and build it based on data retrieved by ohai.\nYou can also optionally put other host keys in a data bag called \"ssh_known_hosts\".\nSee below for details.\n\nRequirements\n============\n\nShould work on any platform that uses `/etc/ssh/known_hosts`.\n\nRequires Chef Server for search.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nSearches the Chef Server for all hosts that have SSH host keys and\ngenerates an `/etc/ssh/known_hosts`.\n\nAdding custom host keys\n-----------------------\n\nIf you want to add custom host keys for hosts not in your Chef deployment (such\nas github.com, for example), create a data bag called \"`ssh_known_hosts`\" and add\nan item for each host to it that looks like this:\n\n    {\n      \"id\": \"github\",\n      \"fqdn\": \"github.com\",\n      \"rsa\": \"github-rsa-host-key\"\n    }\n\nYou can also specify the following optional values in the data bag:\n\n* ipaddress : Will be resolved from the fqdn value if not specified\n* hostname : Short hostname form of the host without domain name\n* dsa : If the host has a dsa host key, specify it as \"dsa\" instead of \"rsa\"\n\nLicense and Author\n==================\n\nAuthor:: Scott M.
